[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.19676464.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19676464)

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis scripts for the paper:

> Muto, H., & Ogi, T., & Yakoh, T. *Algorithmic Groupthink: Measuring and Mitigating Semantic Convergence in Multi-agent LLM Systems.*

## What is in this repository

- `src/` — Core simulation framework
- `experiments/` — Scripts for running each experiment reported in the paper
- `analysis/` — Scripts for analysis, statistical tests, and figure generation
- `data/raw_outputs/` — Text outputs from all experiments (CSV format)
- `docs/` — Supplementary documentation

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude-3.5-Haiku)
- Google API key (for Gemini-2.0-Flash)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmuto/algorithmic-groupthink-paper.git
cd algorithmic-groupthink
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting API keys

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

## Reproducing the main experiments

### Experiment 1: Reference mode comparison (20 tasks)

```bash
python experiments/run_exp1_reference_modes.py --mode individual
python experiments/run_exp1_reference_modes.py --mode all
python analysis/analyze_exp1.py
```

Expected output: individual-history shows diversity increase (+10.3%), group-history shows decrease (−5.9%).

### Experiment 2: Dose-response (share ratio)

```bash
for ratio in 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0; do
  python src/simulation.py --reference-mode all --share-ratio $ratio \
    --outdir results_exp2_ratio_${ratio//./_}
done
```

### Experiment 3: Countermeasures

```bash
python experiments/run_exp3_countermeasures.py --mode diversity_prompt
python experiments/run_exp3_countermeasures.py --mode adversarial
python analysis/analyze_countermeasures.py
```

### Cross-model replication

```bash
python experiments/run_crossmodel_experiments.py --model claude-3-5-haiku
python experiments/run_crossmodel_experiments.py --model gemini-2.0-flash
python experiments/run_gpt4o_replication.py
```

### Control experiments

```bash
python experiments/run_control_experiments.py
```

### Sentence-BERT robustness validation

```bash
python analysis/validate_sentence_bert.py
```

## Raw data format

Each CSV file under `data/raw_outputs/` has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp of generation |
| `reference_mode` | `individual` or `all` (or share ratio for Exp. 2) |
| `task_id` | Task identifier (e.g., `idea_0`, `creative_3`) |
| `category` | `idea`, `reasoning`, `summarization`, or `creative_writing` |
| `task` | Full task prompt given to agents |
| `iteration` | Iteration index (k = 0, 1, 2, ..., K) |
| `candidate` | Agent index (0--4, five agents per task) |
| `final_output` | Raw text output after the Gen-Critic-Sum workflow |
